;----------------------Question 1


#|
solvebasic is a relatively simple function that has a single parameter, which is an A2expr exclusively  of the form (operator atom1 atom2)

If the operator is not '+, '- or '*, we return the expression, unchanged.
If the operator is '+ and either atom is 0, we return just the other atom. Else, we return the entire expression, unchanged
If the operator is '* and either atom is 1, we return just the other atom. Else, we return the entire expression, unchange
If the operator is '- and atom2 is 0, we return atom1. Else, we return the entire expression, unchanged.

|#



(defun solvebasic (expr)
  (cond 
   ((eq (car expr) '*)
    (cond ((eq (cadr expr) '1)
	   (caddr expr))
	  
	  ((eq (caddr expr) '1)
	   (cadr expr))
	  
	   (T
	    expr)))
   
   ((eq (car expr) '+)
    (cond ((eq (cadr expr) '0)
	   (caddr expr))

	   ((eq (caddr expr) '0)
	   (cadr expr))
	  
	   (T
	   expr)))
	
   ((eq (car expr) '-)
    (if (eq (caddr expr) '0)
	(cadr expr)
      expr)
    )

   (T
    expr)))

#| 
remove-identites takes a single parameter, an a2-expresion. There are 3 possible cases.
Case 1: entire expression is a single atom, ex 5. It obviously cannot be simplified, so is returned as is

Case 2: expression is of form (operator e1 e2), where both e1 and e2 are atoms. We call solvebasic to see if it can simplify it

Case 3: expression is of form (operator e1 e2), where either e1 or e2 or both are not atoms. That means that there is a possiblity that
they can be reduced further, which the function does by recursive calling itself with e1 or e2 as input, as needed. Technically, this
can be done in a single cond subexpression, but I made 3 to reduce recursive calls when they are not needed (if e1 or e2 is an atom)

Since the necissary depth of recursion is unknown, and we do not want an infinite loop of attempts to reduce the expression, we stop
the recursion when an additional run of the program produces the same result E as it started with.

|#

(defun remove-identities (expr)
  (cond ((atom expr) expr) 
	
	((and  (not (atom (cadr expr))) (not (atom (caddr expr))))	 
	 (if (equal expr (append (list(car expr)) (list (remove-identities (cadr expr))) (list(remove-identities (caddr expr)))))
	     expr
	   (remove-identities (append (list(car expr)) (list (remove-identities (cadr expr))) (list(remove-identities (caddr expr)))))))

	
	((not (atom (cadr expr))) 
	 (if (equal expr (append (list(car expr)) (list(remove-identities (cadr expr))) (list(caddr expr))))
	     expr
	   (remove-identities (append (list(car expr)) (list(remove-identities (cadr expr))) (list(caddr expr))))))

	((not (atom (caddr expr)))
	 (if (equal expr (append (list(car expr)) (list(cadr expr)) (list(remove-identities (caddr expr)))))
	     expr
	   (remove-identities (append (list(car expr)) (list(cadr expr)) (list(remove-identities (caddr expr)))))))

	(T
	 (solvebasic expr))))


;----------------------------------Question 2

#|
simplifybasic works almost identically to solvebasic from question 1. Input is strictly (operator atom1 atom2).
if operator is not '- or '*, return E, unchanged.
If operator is '- and atom1 = atom1, return 0. Else, return E unchanged
If operator is '* and either atom1 or atom2 is 0, return 0. Else, return E unchanged.


|#


(defun simplifybasic (expr)
(cond 
 ((eq (car expr) '*)
  (cond ((eq (cadr expr) '0)
	 '0)
	
	((eq (caddr expr) '0)
	 '0)
	
	(T
	 expr)))
 
 ((eq (car expr) '-)
  (if (equal (caddr expr) (cadr expr))
      '0
    expr)
  )
 
 (T
  expr)))

#| 
Also works nearly identically to remove-identities in question 1. Only addition/change other than names of function and its helper function
is that we take into account an additional case where E is (- e1 e2), e1 and e2 (we cannot just leave it for the helper function to solve, 
because of a case where e1, e2 not atoms, e1 = e2. In this case, we can return 0 immediately without need for any simplifications of the nested
subexxpressions.

(defun simplify-zeroes (expr)
  (cond ((atom expr) expr)  
	
	((and (eq (car expr) '-) (equal (cadr expr) (caddr expr))) 0)
	
	((and  (not (atom (cadr expr))) (not (atom (caddr expr))))
	 (if (equal expr (append (list(car expr)) (list (simplify-zeroes(cadr expr))) (list(simplify-zeroes (caddr expr)))))
	     expr
	   (simplify-zeroes (append (list(car expr)) (list (simplify-zeroes(cadr expr))) (list(simplify-zeroes (caddr expr)))))))	
	
	((not (atom (cadr expr))) 
	 (if (equal expr (append (list(car expr)) (list(simplify-zeroes(cadr expr))) (list(caddr expr))))
	     expr
	   (simplify-zeroes (append (list(car expr)) (list(simplify-zeroes(cadr expr))) (list(caddr expr))))))
	
	((not (atom (caddr expr)))
	 (if (equal expr (append (list(car expr)) (list(cadr expr)) (list(simplify-zeroes (caddr expr)))))
	     expr
	   (simplify-zeroes(append (list(car expr)) (list(cadr expr)) (list(simplify-zeroes (caddr expr)))))))
	
	(T
	 (simplifybasic expr))))

;-------------------------Question 3


#| 
Fairly simple implementation. We do not know the needed recursion depth, aka number of times we need
to use remove-identities or simplify-zeroes. 

Therefore function recursively calls itself on output of remove-identities or simplify-zeroes. 
If it cannot be simplified by remove-identities we try to simplify it by simplify-zeroes. 
If neither function gives an output that is different to the e that that iteration of simplify 
started with, we know we are done, so we return that e as the answer.



|#


(defun simplify (e)
  (cond 
   ((not (equal e (remove-identities e)))
    (simplify (remove-identities e)))
   ((not (equal e (simplify-zeroes e)))
    (simplify (simplify-zeroes e)))
   (T
     e)))
   

;-------------------------------- Question 4

#|
Takes a Pexp that is has been already sorted. Return the same P, minus any terms that have O-coefficents. If the entire P is just (0 . 0), returns nil instead
Works by recursively calling itself with a (rest P) as new P. Recursion stops if there is just one term left in P. 
|#

(defun zeroes (P)
  (cond ((equal P '((0 . 0)))
	 nil)
	((null (cdr P))
	 (if (equal (caar P) 0)
	     nil
	   p))
	((not(equal (caar P) '0))
	 (cons(car P) (zeroes (cdr P))))
	(t (zeroes (cdr P)))))
	
#| 
Customs sorting function. Sorts by highest cdr term, therefore dotted pairs with higher cdr, or power, end up first, followed by terms with lower cdr/power. 
|#

	
(defun exponent-order (term1 term2)
  (> (cdr term1) (cdr term2)))


#| 
Accepts as input 2 dotted pairs. It's assumed that p1 is a valid pair, but p2 might be null, in which case we just return p1 (any number + 0 = that number)
If the two pair have the same cdr term or power, we return a single dotted pair in a list that is the sum of their car terms (coefficents), and their shared
cdr term (power). Else return both, unchanged.

some tests cases to explain better:

(combine-like-terms-helper '(2 . 5) '()          -> '((2 . 5))
(combine-like-terms-helper '(2 . 5) '(-3 . 5)    -> '((-1 . 5))
(combine-like-terms-helper '(2 . 5) '(-3 . 2)    -> '((2. 5) (-3 . 2))

|#

(defun combine-like-terms-helper (p1 p2)
  (if (null p2)
      (list p1)
    (if (eq (cdr p1) (cdr p2))
	(list(cons (+ (car p1) (car p2)) (cdr p1)))
      (list p1 p2))))


#|
Given list of dotted pairs P, groups them in pairs (first and second, third and fourth, fifth and sixth, etc).
For each such pair, calls combine-like-terms-helper. 
There are two flaws here, that will need to be fixed in a later function:
flaw 1: we have more than 2 terms with the same power in a row. 
flaw 2: we have terms that have same power that are not grouped together (for example, term 2 and 3 wouldn't be called together
for combine-like-terms-helper.

This is quite confusing, so here are some sample outputs highlighting successes and flaws:

(combine-like-terms '((1 . 2) (1 . 2)(3 . 1) (2 . 1)))         ->         '((2 . 2)(5 . 1))
(combine-like-terms '((1 . 2) (1 . 1)(2 . 1)) -> '((2 . 2)))   ->         '((1 . 2) (2 . 1) (2. 1))
(combine-like-terms '((1 . 2)(1 . 2)(1 . 2)(1 . 2)))           ->         '((2 . 2)(2 . 2))


|#

(defun combine-like-terms (P)
  (if (null(cddr P))
      (if (equal 1 (length (combine-like-terms-helper (car P) (cadr P))))
	  (list(car(combine-like-terms-helper (car P) (cadr P))))
	(combine-like-terms-helper (car P) (cadr P)))
    (append (combine-like-terms-helper (car P) (cadr P)) (combine-like-terms (cddr P)))))


#| 


|#



(defun s (P)
  (cond ((not(equal P (combine-like-terms P)))
	 (s (combine-like-terms P)))
	(t
	 (combine-like-terms P))))




(defun m (P)
  (cond ((not(equal (combine-like-terms P) P))
	 (m (combine-like-terms P)))
	((null (cdr P))
	 P)
	(t
	 (cons (car (combine-like-terms P)) (s (cdr P))))))

	

#| 
First, sorts P according to highest power first using exponent-order
Then, combines any terms with the same power using m
Finally, removes any terms with zero-coefficents with zeroes.


|#


(defun normalize (P)
  (zeroes (m (sort P 'exponent-order))))


;-------------------------------Question 5


#| 
Normalize already handles addition. Just append p1 and p2 and call normalize with the resulting P
|#

(defun poly-add (P1 P2)
  (normalize (append P1 P2)))


#| 
Given a dotted pair, negates the car element of it.
|#

(defun negate-helper (P)
  (cons (* -1 (car P)) (cdr P)))

#|
Recursively builds a new list of dotted pairs, with the help of negate-helper, the car of each dotted pair being * -1
that of the original P
|#

(defun negate (P)
  (if (null (cdr P))
      (list(negate-helper (car P)))
    (append (list(negate-helper (car P))) (negate (cdr P)))))


#| 
Since subtracting A from B is equal to adding -1 * A to B, that's what we do, using negate on P2
|#
(defun poly-subtract (P1 P2)
  (poly-add P1 (negate P2)))


#| 
Takes two dotted pairs and multiplies them. This is done by multiplying the car terms, and adding the cdr terms,
and creating a new base pair with the resulting car and cdr.
|#


(defun basic-multiply (P1 P2)
  (cons (* (car P1) (car P2)) (+ (cdr P1) (cdr P2))))


#| 
Given an single dotted pair P1, and a list of dotted pairs P2, multiplies every pair in P2 by P1
and returns the result as a new list of dotted pairs
|#

(defun multiply-left (P1 P2)
  (if (null (cdr P2))
      (list(basic-multiply P1 (car P2)))
    (append (list (basic-multiply P1 (car P2))) (multiply-left P1 (cdr P2)))))

#| 
Given a list of dotted pairs, multiplies every element of P1 by every element of P2
and returns the result a single list of dotted pairs
|#

(defun multiply-right (P1 P2)
   (if (null (cdr P1))
      (multiply-left (car P1) P2)
    (append (multiply-left (car P1)  P2) (multiply-right (cdr P1) P2))))


#| 
If either P is nil, return nil. Else, call multiply-right with the 2 Ps, then normalize the result
|#

(defun poly-multiply (P1 P2)
  (cond ((null P1) nil)
	((null P2) nil)
	(t (normalize (multiply-right P1 P2)))))

#| 
Recursively multiplies, subtracts or adds, depending on operator. Special base case for integer, and one for 'x. 
Returns P-exp
|#



(defun Polynomial (E)
  (cond ((integerp E)
	 (list(cons E 0)))
	
	((atom E)
	 (list(cons 1 1)))

	((equal (car E) '*)
	 (poly-multiply (Polynomial (cadr E)) (Polynomial (caddr E))))
	 
	((equal (car E) '-)
	 (poly-subtract (Polynomial (cadr E)) (Polynomial (caddr E))))

	((equal (car E) '+)
	 (poly-add (Polynomial (cadr E)) (Polynomial (caddr E))))

))







;----------------------------------Question 6



(defun concat (s1 s2)
  (concatenate 'string s1 s2))


#| 
termstring and onlyterm-string are essentially the same function, but return a slightly different output
because you (1 . 1) is "x" if it's the only term, but "+ x" if there is one before it, for example. Termstring
will be called once for every term except the first in print-pexpr

Takes a single dotted pair and returns the output as a string in normal form
